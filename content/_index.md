        For most of my career, I've worked on SaaS products (with a little e-commerce sprinkled in) as an individual contributor, manager, and co-founder. I like to focus on establishing vision, standards, and good relationships. I enjoy learning about how people think and I use these learnings to guide product strategy as well as design experiences that support both the customer and the business.
        </p>
        <p>I value collaboration, strive for trust, expect honesty, and believe in getting stuff done by putting people first. Some of the <a href="/ux-design">work I've done</a> over the years includes feature team project work as an embedded designer, running discovery and research for improvement and zero-to-one projects, developing scalable and utility-driven design systems, growing and developing design teams through hiring and evangelism, establishing better design processes, and shaping design strategy and product vision.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm currently based in Phoenix, AZ with my wife and daughter who both bring me an immense amount of joy. I hope this site gives you some insight into who I am, how I work, and what I can do. I put a lot of time, care, and learning into building it so I'm happy you were able to stop by.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy chatting about passions, experiences, the future, watches, keyboards, and more! So, please <a href="mailto:hi@jefforshalick.com">send me an email</a> and share something fun about yourself!
        </p>
