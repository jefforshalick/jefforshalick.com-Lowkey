        I've worked on enterprise and consumer e-commerce products as an individual contributor, manager, and co-founder. I like to focus on establishing vision, standards, and good relationships. I enjoy learning about how people think and I use these learnings to guide product strategy as well as design experiences that support both the customer and the business.
        </p>
        <p>I value collaboration, strive for trust, expect honesty, and believe in getting stuff done by putting people first. Some of the <a href="/work">work I've done</a> over the years includes feature team project work as an embedded designer, running discovery and research for improvement and zero-to-one projects, developing scalable and utility-driven design systems, growing and developing design teams through hiring and evangelism, establishing better design processes, and shaping design strategy and product vision.

        I'm currently based in Phoenix, AZ with my wife and daughter who both bring me an immense amount of joy. I hope this site gives you some insight into who I am, how I work, and what I can do. I put a lot of time, care, and learning into building it so I'm happy you were able to stop by.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy chatting about passions, experiences, the future, watches, keyboards, and more! <a href="mailto:hi@jefforshalick.com">Send me an email</a> to share something fun about yourself or just say hey.
