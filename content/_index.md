Thanks for stopping by. I've been working as a [product designer](https://linkedin.com/in/jefforshalick) for the past decade and have done a lot of other stuff along the way, too. I love learning, building, and collaborating.

When I'm not spending time with my lovely family 👪,\
I enjoy eating at new restaraunts 🍜,\
playing board games 🎲,\
collecting watches ⌚,\
building keyboards ⌨️,\
building houses 🛠️,\
playing tennis 🎾,\
playing melee 🎮,\
and traveling 🧭.

You can see some of [my work](/work/) or, if you're curious, you can take a look at some [not work stuff](/not-work/). Below are some pictures of me doing fun things!
