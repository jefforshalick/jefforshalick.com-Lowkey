Thanks for stopping by 🙏. I've been working as a Product Designer 🏗️ for the past decade 🕙 and you can see some of [my work here](/work/) 👨‍💻. I also do things [outside of work stuff](/not-work/) 💃 that I sometimes[^1] share here.

When I'm not spending time with my lovely family 👪, I enjoy eating at new restaraunts 🍜, playing board games 🎲, collecting watches ⌚, building keyboards ⌨️, building houses 🛠️, playing tennis 🎾, playing melee 🎮, and traveling 🧭.

Below are some pictures of me doing fun things 🥳 with people I love ❤️!
