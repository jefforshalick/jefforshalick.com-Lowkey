Thanks for stopping by. I've been working as a [product designer](https://linkedin.com/in/jefforshalick) for the past decade and have done a lot of other stuff along the way, too. I love learning, building, and collaborating.

When I have time outside of spending it with my lovely family 👪, I enjoy collecting watches ⌚, playing board games 🎲, building keyboards ⌨️, building houses 🛠️, eating at new restaraunts 🍜 , playing tennis 🎾, and traveling ✈️.

If you're interested, you can see some of [my work](/work/) as well as some [not work stuff](/not-work/). Below are some pictures of me doing fun things!
