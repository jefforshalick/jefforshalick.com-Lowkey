I design and build architecture using modern practices with a focus on quality. In addition to design, I've honed my craft in many of the trades such as framing, concrete work, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and more. My style is modern but even when I build new, I respect the history and landscape of what's already there. Below, you can find some samples of my work.
