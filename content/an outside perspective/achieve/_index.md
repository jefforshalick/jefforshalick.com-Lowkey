# Helping More People Say Yes: Opportunities for Achieve’s Product Growth

I’ve spent most of my career building for other businesses—but I’ve always been drawn to tools that help
my fellow people feel more in control. So when I started digging into Achieve’s mission and product space, I couldn’t help but imagine the impact great design has and can make here.

Of course, I’m just starting to learn about Achieve from the outside. But instead of holding back, I decided to **lean into that outsider perspective**. I looked at the funnel, browsed marketing and support content, read reviews, and asked myself: *where are the little frictions and missed moments that might be getting in the way of a member saying “yes”?*

Below are a few areas that stood out—not as critiques, but as curious hypotheses. If even one of these seems useful or sparks a conversation, I’ll consider it a win.

## 1. Surface Confidence, Not Just Eligibility

**What I noticed:** Early product flows focus on eligibility and personalization, which is great. But confidence around*“this will really work for me”* might be the missing ingredient that moves someone from intrigued to committed.

**Curious opportunity:**  
How might we help potential members visualize success from the first few moments? Could we introduce empathetic language, mini success stories, or tools like progress indicators that reframe the process as something achievable and human?

## 2. Let Marketing Do More Inside the Product

**What I noticed:** Marketing at Achieve is strong externally. But once someone enters a funnel, the brand voice and emotional resonance fade behind form fields and financial inputs.

**Curious opportunity:**  
How might we bring more of Achieve’s compassion, clarity, and optimism *into* the start of the product experience? Could we build modular, testable moments that tie brand storytelling to decision-making points that leads to more consumer confidence?

## 3. Rethink Drop-Offs as Signals, Not Failures

**What I noticed:** Some product paths seem optimized for a binary outcome: convert or drop. But a drop-off could just mean “not now” instead of “never.”

**Curious opportunity:** 
How might we give people more flexible exits like soft saves, reminders, or content-based nudges that let them come back feeling more prepared or already well on their way? Could we reframe drop-off data as “intent expressed, just not fulfilled… yet”?

## 4. Design for People Who Don’t Feel in Control

**What I noticed:** Many members are likely coming to Achieve after a string of financial stressors. In that context, even small decisions can feel overwhelming or high-stakes.

**Curious opportunity:**  
How might we audit flows for *emotional friction* as well as conversion rates? Could we inject more micro-moments of clarity, encouragement, and choice—especially in steps that feel all-or-nothing?

## 5. Invest in a System of Experiments, Not Just Individual Tests

**What I noticed:** There seems to be a strong culture of performance and A/B testing, which is great. What if optimization efforts focused on compound learning?

**Curious opportunity:**  
How might we build a more connected testing architecture—where experiments ladder up to big hypotheses and performance informs design strategy? Could we move from tactical to thematic testing? I'd love to dig into this and see where it takes us.

## 6. Make It Feel Like Financial Momentum, Not Just a Product Flow

**What I noticed:** The flows are functional and clear—but sometimes that clarity feels sterile and without emotion. There’s an opportunity to make the experience feel like movement toward a better future where we are holding the customer's hand the whole way.

**Curious opportunity:**  
How might we inject a sense of **momentum** and **pulling** into the UI itself—through animations, language, checkpoints, and positive reinforcement? Can we design the feeling of progress as carefully as the path, itself?

## Final Thoughts

I’m excited about what Achieve is building; not just because of the product, but because of the impact it can have on people's lives. I’d love to bring my experience, energy, and outside-in thinking to the team. In the meantime, thanks for the conversation so far, and I hope this gets your wheels turning for future conversations.
